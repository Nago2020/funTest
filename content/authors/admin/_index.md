I am a postdoc researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, affiliated with the ORSTAT department within the Faculty of Economics and Business. Before moving to KU Leuven, I held a lectureship position at Wollega University, Ethiopia. This position allowed me to teach several undergraduate and graduate courses, including Multivariate Statistics, Statistical Inference, Regression Analysis, Biostatistics for pharmacy, and Research methods. I often write R codes to conduct analyses and inferences for my research projects.

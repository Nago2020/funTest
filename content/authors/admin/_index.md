I am a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven, Belgium, affiliated with the ORSTAT department within the Faculty of Economics and Business. Before moving to KU Leuven, I held a lectureship position at Wollega University, Ethiopia. This position allowed me to teach several courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, including Multivariate Statistics, Regression Analysis, Statistical Inference and Biostatistics.
